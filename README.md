## What can Vediamo do?
     
Vediamo can perform various tasks on your Mercedes Benz vehicle, such as:
     
- Offline configuration (coding) of ECUs without the need of SCN (Software Calibration Number) online coding. This means you can change the settings and parameters of your ECUs without connecting to the internet or the Mercedes Benz server.
- Flashing (updating) of ECUs with new firmware or software versions. This can improve the performance and functionality of your ECUs, as well as fix some bugs or errors.
- Programming of ECUs with custom scripts or functions. This can enable some hidden or advanced features of your ECUs, such as activating video in motion, changing the speed limit, or modifying the engine map.
- Changing the configuration of ECUs to match different hardware or software versions. This can help you adapt your ECUs to new or replaced components, such as sensors, injectors, or modules.
- Distributed diagnostics with multiple simultaneous special client applications. This can help you monitor and control different aspects of your vehicle's operation, such as test run control over PSR adapter while simultaneously verifying with Ecoute.
- Diagnosis, coding, or flashing of multiple ECUs simultaneously. This can save you time and effort when working on complex systems or networks of ECUs.

## What are the benefits of Vediamo?
     
Vediamo can offer you many benefits as a Mercedes Benz owner or enthusiast, such as:

You can also modify the behavior and performance of your ECUs to improve your driving experience, such as adjusting the steering angle, throttle response, or suspension mode.
- Optimizing your vehicle's performance and functionality. You can update your ECUs with new firmware or software versions to enhance their capabilities and efficiency. You can also program your ECUs with custom scripts or functions to unlock some hidden or advanced features that are not available in the standard configuration.
- Troubleshooting and repairing your vehicle's problems. You can diagnose your ECUs for any errors or faults and clear them with Vediamo.
